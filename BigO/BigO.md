# Asymptotic analyis

## Big O

_O(1)_ - Constant - no loops
_O(n)_ - Linear - for while loops
_O(n!)_ - Factorial - you are adding a loop for every element

**Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)**
**Two separate collections: O(a + b)**

## Rule Book

- Worst Case
- Remove Constants
- Different terms for inputs
- Drop Non Dominants

## 3 Pillars of Programming

- _Readable_
- _Memory_ - Space Complexity
- _Speed_ - Time Complexity

## Causes space complexity

- Variables
- Data Structures
- Function Call
- Allocations

## Javascript Engine

_Memory Heap_ - where we store variables
_Call Stack_ - where we keep track our function calls
